    "## Source: Dota 2 game\n",
    "\n",
    "[Dota 2](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dota_2) is a multiplayer computer game of the genre [MOBA](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOBA). Players play matches between themselves. In each match two teams participate, 5 people in each. One team plays for the bright side (The Radiant), the other for the dark (The Dire). The goal of each team is to destroy the main building of the enemy base (throne).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [different game modes](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_modes/ru), we will consider the mode [Captain's Mode](http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Game_modes/ru#Captain.27s_Mode), in the format of which most of the Dota 2 e-sports events take place.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How is the match going\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Players choose the heroes\n",
    "\n",
    "In total, the game has just over 100 different heroes (characters). At the beginning of the game, the teams in a certain order choose the heroes themselves and prohibit the choice of certain heroes to the enemy (bans). Each player will manage one hero, within the same match there can not be several identical heroes. Heroes differ in their characteristics and abilities. The success of the team largely depends on the combination of the chosen characters.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 2. Action\n",
    "\n",
    "Players can receive gold and experience for killing other characters or other units. Accumulated experience affects the level of the hero, which in turn allows you to improve abilities. For the accumulated gold, players buy items that improve the characteristics of the characters or give them new abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "After death, the hero goes to the \"tavern\" and is reborn only after some time, so the team loses the player for a while, but the player can buy the hero out of the tavern for a certain amount of gold ahead of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the game, the teams develop their heroes, defend their part of the field and attack the enemy.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](http://imgur.com/5b0SlQb.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The end\n",
    "\n",
    "The game ends when one of the teams destroys a certain number of enemy \"towers\" and destroys the throne.\n",

    "As a quality metric, we will use the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). Note that the AUC-ROC is a quality metric for an algorithm that gives out first class grades. Both algorithms that will be used in the project - gradient boosting and logistic regression - are able to produce such estimates. For this you need to get predictions using the function predict_proba. It returns two columns: the first contains estimates of belonging to the zero class, the second - the first class. You need values from the second column:\n",

    "### Way 1: Gradient boosting\n",
    "One of the most versatile algorithms is gradient boosting. It is not very demanding on data, restores non-linear dependencies, and works well on many data sets, which determines its popularity. It is a reasonable idea to try it for him in the first place. Checkpoints to be reached:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the table with the tags from the features.csv file using the code above. Remove the attributes associated with the outcome of the match (they are marked in the data description as missing in the test set).\n",
    "2. Check the sample for gaps using the count () function, which for each column shows the number of filled values. Are there many gaps in the data? Write down the names of the signs that have omissions, and try for any two of them to give a reason why their values may be missing.\n",
    "3. Replace blanks with zeros using the fillna () function. In fact, this method is preferable for logistic regression, since it will allow the missing value to make no contribution to the prediction. For trees, often the best option is to replace the pass with a very large or very small value - in this case, when building a vertex partition, you can send objects with gaps to a separate branch of the tree. There are also other approaches - for example, replacing a pass with an average value of a sign. We do not require this in the task, but if you wish, try different approaches to the processing of passes and compare them with each other.\n",
    "3. Which column contains the target variable? Write down its name.\n",
    "4. Forget that there are categorical signs in the sample, and we will try to train the gradient boosting over the trees on the existing \"objects-features\" matrix. Fix the split generator for cross-validation of 5 blocks (KFold), do not forget to mix the sample (shuffle = True), because the data in the table is sorted by time, and without mixing you can face undesirable effects when evaluating the quality. Assess the quality of the gradient boosting (GradientBoostingClassifier) using this cross-validation, try a different number of trees (at least test the following values for the number of trees: 10, 20, 30). How long have classifiers been configured? Is the optimum at the tested values of the n_estimators parameter, or is the quality likely to continue to increase with its further increase?\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Questions to be answered\n",
    "1. What signs have omissions among their values? What can the gaps in these signs mean (answer this question for any two signs)?\n",
    "2. What is the name of the column containing the target variable?\n",
    "3. How long was cross-validation done for gradient boosting with 30 trees? Instructions for measuring time can be found below. What is the quality with this? Recall that in this assignment we use the AUC-ROC quality metric.\n",
    "4. Does it make sense to use more than 30 trees in a gradient boost? What would you suggest to do to speed up his training while increasing the number of trees?"

    "### Way 2: Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear methods work much faster than tree compositions, so it seems reasonable to use them to speed up data analysis. One of the most common methods for classification is logistic regression. Checkpoints to be reached:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Assess the quality of the logistic regression (sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression with L2 regularization) using cross-validation using the same scheme that was used for gradient boosting. Pick the best regularization parameter (C). What is the best quality you got? How does it compare to the quality of the gradient boost? How can you explain this difference? Is logistic regression faster than gradient boosting?\n",
    "2. Among the signs in the sample there are categorical ones that we used as numerical ones, which is hardly a good idea. The categorical features in this problem are eleven: lobby_type and r1_hero, r2_hero, ..., r5_hero, d1_hero, d2_hero, ..., d5_hero. Remove them from the sample, and cross-validate for logistic regression on the new sample with the selection of the best regularization parameter. Has the quality changed? How can you explain this?\n",
    "3. In the previous step, we removed the rM_hero and dM_hero signs from the sample, which show which heroes played for each team. These are important signs - heroes have different characteristics, and some of them win more often than others. Find out from the data how many different hero identifiers exist in this game (you may need the unique or value_counts function).\n",
    "4. We use the \"bag of words\" approach to encode information about the characters. Let there be N different heroes in the game. We form N signs, with the i-th being equal to zero if the i-th hero did not participate in the match; a unit if the i-th hero played for the Radiant team; minus one if i-th hero played for Dire team. Below you can find the code that performs this conversion. Add the resulting characters to the numeric characters that you used in the second paragraph of this stage.\n",
    "5. Cross-validate the logistic regression on the new sample with the selection of the best regularization parameter. What is the quality? Has it improved? How can you explain this?\n",
    "6. Build a prediction of the probability of winning the Radiant team for a test sample using the best model studied (the best in terms of AUC-ROC cross-validation). Make sure that the predicted probabilities are adequate - they are located on the interval [0, 1], do not coincide with each other (ie, the model did not turn out to be constant).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Questions to be answered:\n",
    "1. What is the quality of the logistic regression over all the original features? How does it compare to the quality of the gradient boost? How can you explain this difference? Is logistic regression faster than gradient boosting?\n",
    "2. How does the removal of categorical features affect the quality of logistic regression (indicate the new value of the quality metric)? How can you explain this change?\n",
    "3. How many different hero identifiers exist in this game?\n",
    "4. What is the quality when adding a \"bag of words\" for the characters? Has it improved from the previous version? How can you explain this?\n",
    "5. What is the minimum and maximum value of the forecast on the test sample obtained from the best of the algorithms?"
